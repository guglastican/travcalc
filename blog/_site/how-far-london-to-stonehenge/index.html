Under ideal traffic conditions, the drive usually takes around 2 hours, though this can vary significantly depending on the time of day and volume of traffic, particularly when leaving the capital.</p>
<p>For a smoother experience, planning your departure to avoid London's notorious rush hours is highly advisable.
